### (*Based on neversink's POE2 'lite filter'*)

## What

This is my *slight* edit of neversink's initial poe2filter. just customizing the colors and any things that may help me via filter edits.  If somehow you are here and are uncertain if this is what you should use, _get the original source script from **neversink**, this is a customized fork of his repo's [GitHub Link](https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-PoE2litefilter/releases/latest)! .

## Neversink's Original Readme

This is here for posterity; may also be _outdated_, as i plan to only update the Customized Part Above.

### **QUICK START:**

This is an "ItemFilter" - a script for the game Path of Exile 2 (not PoE1!). It highlights valuable items, hide pointless drops and enhances gameplay comfort and experience.

This is *NOT* a hack/mod. It written using the official POE filter domain language. This script (NeverSink's Filter) is shipped on the console versions of the game.

This is a fairly light filter. This repository will be reused in the future to expand and replace this filter with a fully-fledged one.

Feature highlights:

- Does NOT hide items. Only highlights valuable drops!
- Highlight for all important PoE2 currencies with minimal tiering
- Minimal sounds, beams and fontsizes for highlight desirable items
- Special currency highlight
- Highlight for rings, amulets and belts
- Better gold visualization
- Highlight for gems, runes, jewels and other special character progression items
- Adds map icons to important drops
- Socketed and quality items (not super happy with border, but works well)

NOT yet implemented (coming soon hopefully):

- No way to highlight 'tier' items (not supported by PoE as of now)
- No filterblade support
- No way to install on consoles
- No strictness/style support
- No economy based tiering

## **IMPORTANT: MUST READ:**

0) This is a new and experimental filter, it has WAY less polishing and is not even comparable in scope to my POE1 filter. Tread with caution and please provide feedback! 
1) The filters in this GitHub project are ALWAYS updated before the start of a new league (4-6 hours before start). Afterwards, usually every few weeks.
2) The filters from this GitHub project do NOT auto-update. At least redownload the latest version once a league - better once a month - to stay up-to-date and not miss out on valuable drops! There is an auto-updater, read about it below.
3) Filters can't distinguish between different variations of one unique base! A unique "Leather Belt" can be an expensive "Headhunter" or a cheap "Wurm's Molt". The same goes for all unique jewels etc. Things that need manual checking usually have a blue icon on the minimap!
